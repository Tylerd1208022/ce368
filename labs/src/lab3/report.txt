Version 1: First Working Solution

Strategy: 
 - Unroll input into 1d input (better spatial locality - closer groupings in memory)
 - Use if statement to prevent overflow
 - AtomicAdd to increase count value
 - Write back to histogram without atomic add: one entry per thread to avoid overlap
 - Only use one thread for simplicity

1000 Iteration Time: 0.001151

Optimization 1: Padding on Shared Memory Histogram to reduce (remove) bank conflicts

Optimization 2: Use 32 Threads, 1 Block

Optimiazation 3a: Use Multiple blocks

Optimization 3b: Use Multiple Blocks, Warp vote on combination

Optimization 4: (not sure if this one is worth it) Dont unroll input

Optimization 5: Warp vote during loop of increments

Optimization 6: Do a mini reduction at the end (Only use enough blocks/threads to have it be manageable)
